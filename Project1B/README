To seperate but connect programs, lab1b-client and lab1b-server connect and work together. Lab1b-server must be run first,
and it awaits a client to connect to it. The server allows the client to merely talk echo characters to it,
or to run a shell with the --shell=<shellname> argument. Communication can also be compressed both ways between the client and server
with the --compress argument.

---------
lab1b-server.c
----------

Usage: lab1b-server --port=<portNumber> --shell=<shellName> --compress

portNumber can be any port greater than 1024. It is a required argument.
shell will run a shell and feed the clients input into it and output the outputs of the shell
to the client. 
compress sets up the server to communicate in a compressed format, with the <zlib> library.

-----------
lab1b-client.c
-------------
Usage: lab1b-server --port=<portNumber> --log=<fileName> --compress

portNumber must be the port of the server. It is a required argument.
log is optional, and will write all the traffic of the client to a log. If the compressed tag is on it will output the
compressed traffic.
the compress tag is optional, it sets up the client to communicate in compressed language using <zlib>.
If the server is compressed, the client must be, and the alternative is true.
