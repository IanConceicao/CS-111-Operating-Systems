    lab0.c 
    -------
        lab0.c is the sole source file. It looks at standard input and outputs it to standard output.
        If it is executed with the --input=<filename> and/or the --output=<other_filename> it will take 
        input from filename and output to other_filename. Either can be called independently. It also has
        a --segmentation argument which will cause a segmentation fault, and a --catch argument which will
        catch the segmentation fault.
    
    -------
    Makefile
    -------
        The makefile can build the project, by calling 'make'. It can be the distribution to turn in with
        "make dist". It can also run a smoke test with "make check". The smoke test has the following tests:

        Smoke Test Cases
        ---------------
        stdToStdout, tests if the code exits with 0 from stdin to stdout
        fileToFile, tests if both the input and output file have the same contents after running
        goodExit, tests the same as above but making sure it has an exit code of 0
        badArg, tests if a bad argument gives an exit code of 1
        badInputFile, tests if an input file that does not exits gives an exit code of 2
        badOutputFile, tests if an output file that is unreadable and writable gives an exit code of 3
        catch, tests that catch returns an exit code of 4
        segfault, tests that a segmentation fault gives an exit code of 134

        Program was ran under gdb with --segmentation. A breakpoint was set at the bad assignment. The pointer
        was confirmed to be of NULL.
